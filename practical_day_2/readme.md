# Day 2 practical: multi-omic integration with cosmos

Material for the practical: https://github.com/saezlab/cosmosR/blob/master/vignettes/tutorial.md

You can also clone the cosmosR repository on your local machine (see: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open the tutorial.Rmd in Rstudio

Requires R>= 4.1

## Installation

Instal cosmos

```r
# install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("saezlab/cosmosR")

# Install an older stable version of CARNIVAL (1.3.0)
remotes::install_github("saezlab/CARNIVAL@b3a84c6ba9706547caca02644566d75ee621f568")
```

## Running COSMOS

## Interpreting a COSMOS network

In the following PDF: https://www.embopress.org/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.15252%2Fmsb.20209730&file=msb20209730-sup-0001-Appendix.pdf

Appendix Figure 2 is a network generated by COSMOS to connect deregualted TFs, kinases and metabolites in kidney cancer compared to healthy kidney tissue. Such network can often be a bit overwhelming because they contain a lot of condensed information. Their interpretation is however relativelly straightforward. The following exercices will help you learn how to interpret biological mechanistic hyptheses and use them to guide biological studies forward.

Pick a short path connecting several nodes together, preferably containing both TF and metabolties or Kinase and metabolites. Search with google scholar, pubmed, or any search engine of your liking, for any mention of interactions between the members of the path you choose in other studies. 

Assess the relevance of your findings: is it a similar type of disease (e.g. cancer) or different type of disease ? How many studies actually report these interactions already ? What are the phenotypic hallmarks of those studies (inflammation, immune invasion, metabolic starvation, metastasis, etc...) ?

Is this connection a potentially interesting futur therapeutic target: Is it a connection that is specific to disease phenotype or general biological function ? Are there existing inhibitors that can target key nodes ofthe pathway? Are there obvious biological alternative routes that could help the cancer cells escape the treatment ? Are those genes associated with poor prognostic (check https://www.proteinatlas.org/)?

What futur experiments could be planed validate this set of mechanistic hypotheses ?
